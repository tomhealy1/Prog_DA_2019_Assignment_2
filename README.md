## Assignment outline
The purpose of this assignment is to synthesize a dataset which describes a real world phenomenon using the numpy.random package to assign the distributions to each variable. I have chosen HR data of the fictional company Aero-tech Industries and I have used the IBM HR dataset as a reference.  The jupyter notebook contains the tasks outlines in the [assignment](https://github.com/tomhealy1/Prog_DA_2019_Assignment_2/blob/master/ProgDA_Project.pdf). The instructions for running the notebook are below.

The assignment will be broken down into 4 main parts:

## 1. Description of the phenomenon -

An very brief overview of the phenomenon  

## 2. Investigation of the phenomenon variables -

We visualise the variables and describe the variables in the IBM dataset.

## 3. Synthesise the new dataset - 

In section, I create a dataframe and generate the variables using various distributions.

## 4. Explore the new dataset- 

I carry some visual and descriptive exploration of the dataset, do a full print of the new dataset and plot and explain some highlighted relationships. 

## Tools used

This assignment will use a number of different tools to carry out the tasks in the assignment. The tools we will use are:

Python - see instructions below on how to install:

* Pandas - Data Manipulation

* Numpy - numerical/computational operations

* Matplotlib - Data Visualisation

* Scipy (scipy.stats) - An additional numerical package (some extra distributions exist in Scipy)

* Seaborn - An additional data visualisation package

## Instructions

1. If you have not already done so, please download the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) for Python 3.7.

2. Once you install Anaconda, the packages listed above should be installed also.

3. Go to https://github.com/tomhealy1/Prog_DA_2019_Assignment_2 and download the repo

4. Navigate to the folder you saved the repo in using your CLI or terminal

5. Change Directory to the folder, for example:
-- C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop > ```cd C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop\assessment_prog```

6. You can now run the notebook using ```jupyter notebook``` command in the terminal

7. When opened, run all cells.
